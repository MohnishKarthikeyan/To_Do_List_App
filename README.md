# To_Do_List_App

- The To-Do List Manager app is a C++ application developed using RAD Studio (Embarcadero). Its primary purpose is to help users effectively organize their tasks and manage their to-do lists. The app features a user-friendly interface with a clear heading "To-Do List," an input box to capture task entries from the user, and an "Add" button for adding tasks to the list box. Upon clicking the "Add" button, new tasks are instantly added to the list, providing users with a seamless task input experience.

- The two main functionalities of the app are task addition and task deletion. Users can effortlessly add new tasks to their to-do list by typing the task name into the input box and clicking the "Add" button. The newly added task then appears in the list box below the input section. Furthermore, to manage their tasks, users can simply click on a task's name within the list box, and the app will promptly remove the task from the list, effectively marking it as completed or deleted.

- With these intuitive features, the To-Do List Manager app empowers users to maintain an organized and efficient workflow by keeping track of tasks that need to be accomplished and effortlessly managing their progress. Whether it's daily errands, work-related assignments, or personal goals, this app is designed to streamline task management and improve productivity for users across various domains.
